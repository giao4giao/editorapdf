            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Local Storage</h3>
            <p>
              EditoraPDF may use your browser's local storage and session storage to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Save user preferences (zoom level, default settings, theme preferences)</li>

              <li>Enable offline functionality</li>
              <li>Store temporary editing state (only while you're actively editing)</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            <h3>4.2 Server-Side Storage</h3>
            <p>
              We do not store your PDF files on our servers. However, we may store:

              <li>Security logs (IP addresses for fraud prevention)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.3 Security Measures</h3>
            <p>
              Because your files never leave your device:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>There is no risk of server-side data breaches affecting your PDFs</li>
              <li>Your documents cannot be intercepted during upload (because there are no uploads)</li>
              <li>We cannot access your files, even if we wanted to</li>
              <li>Your data is protected by your browser's security features</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We implement industry-standard security measures to protect our website and any data we do collect, including encryption, secure connections (HTTPS), and regular security audits.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Since we don't collect personal information or store your PDF files, there is no personal data to delete from our servers.
