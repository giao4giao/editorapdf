    s4s3aH: 'Option A: Text Watermark',
    s4s3aP1: 'Text watermarks are perfect for adding words like "CONFIDENTIAL," "DRAFT," "SAMPLE," or your company name. They\'re simple, professional, and work well for most use cases.',
    s4s3aP2: "When choosing text watermarks, you'll need to specify:",
    s4s3aL1: 'The text content (what the watermark says)',
    s4s3aL2: 'Font size (typically 24-72 points depending on your needs)',
    s4s3aL3: 'Color (usually gray, but can be customized)',
    s4s3aL4: 'Font style (bold, regular, italic)',
    s4s3aP3s: 'Best for:',
    s4s3aP3: ' Marking documents as drafts, adding confidentiality notices, or simple branding with text.',
    s4s3bH: 'Option B: Image Watermark',
    s4s3bP1: 'Image watermarks are ideal for adding logos, signatures, or custom graphics. They maintain visual quality and can be more distinctive than text watermarks.',
    s4s3bP2: "When using image watermarks, you'll need:",
    s4s3bL1: 'An image file (PNG, JPG, or SVG format works best)',
    s4s3bL2: 'A transparent background (for PNG files) to avoid blocking content',
    s4s3bL3: 'Appropriate image dimensions (not too large or too small)',
    s4s3bP3s: 'Best for:',
    s4s3bP3: ' Adding company logos, professional branding, or custom graphics that represent your organization.',
    s4s3p2s: 'Pro tip:',
    s4s3p2: ' Some tools allow you to add multiple watermarks—for example, a logo in the corner and a "DRAFT" text watermark diagonally. This gives you maximum flexibility for complex branding needs.',

    s4s4h: 'Step 4: Configure Watermark Position',
    s4s4p1: 'Position is crucial for effective watermarking. You want the watermark visible but not intrusive. Most tools offer several preset positions:',
    s4s4l1s: 'Center:',
    s4s4l1: ' Places watermark in the middle of the page (good for "DRAFT" or "SAMPLE" marks)',
    s4s4l2s: 'Diagonal:',
    s4s4l2: ' Places watermark at a 45-degree angle across the page (classic watermark style, less intrusive)',
    s4s4l3s: 'Top center:',

    s4s5p1: 'Fine-tuning the appearance ensures your watermark serves its purpose without being distracting. Key settings include:',
    s4s5l1s: 'Opacity:',
    s4s5l1: ' Controls how transparent the watermark is (typically 20-50% for text, 30-70% for images). Lower opacity makes watermarks less intrusive but still visible',
    s4s5l2s: 'Rotation:',

    s4s5l5: ' For text watermarks, choose a font that\'s readable but not too decorative',
    s4s5p2s: 'Finding the right balance:',
    s4s5m1: 'Too opaque: Watermark obscures content and looks unprofessional',
    s4s5m2: 'Too transparent: Watermark is invisible and serves no purpose',
    s4s5m3: 'Too large: Watermark dominates the page',

    s4s5p3: 'Most tools offer a live preview so you can see how your watermark looks before applying it to the entire document. Use this feature to find the perfect balance.',

    s4s6h: 'Step 6: Select Pages for Watermarking',
    s4s6p1: 'Not every document needs watermarks on every page. Most tools allow you to specify:',
    s4s6l1s: 'All pages:',
    s4s6l1: ' Apply watermark to every page in the document (default option)',
    s4s6l2s: 'Page range:',

    s4s6l3s: 'First page only:',
    s4s6l3: ' Useful for cover pages or title pages',
    s4s6l4s: 'Last page only:',
    s4s6l4: ' Good for signature pages or final pages',
    s4s6l5s: 'Even/odd pages:',
    s4s6l5: ' Apply to alternating pages (less common but available in some tools)',
    s4s6p2s: 'Pro tip:',
    s4s6p2: ' For confidential documents, watermarking all pages provides maximum protection. For branding purposes, sometimes the first page or cover page is sufficient.',

    s4s7h: 'Step 7: Preview Your Watermark',
    s4s7p1: 'Before applying the watermark to your entire document, take advantage of preview features if available. This lets you:',

    // Visible FAQ (13)
    fv1q: 'How do I add a watermark to a PDF file online for free?',
    fv1a_pre: 'You can add a watermark to a PDF file online for free by using our ',
    fv1a_link: 'PDF watermark tool',
    fv1a_post: '. Simply upload your PDF file, choose whether you want a text or image watermark, configure the watermark settings (position, opacity, size, color), select which pages to watermark, and click add watermark. The tool applies the watermark to your document that you can download instantly. No account creation, payment, or software installation required.',
    fv2q: 'Is it safe to add watermarks to PDFs online?',
    fv2a: "Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF watermark tool that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All watermark processing happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your PDFs are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them. This is especially important for watermarking, since you're often marking documents specifically because they contain sensitive information.",
    fv3q: 'Can I add both text and image watermarks to a PDF?',
    fv3a: 'Yes, most online PDF watermark tools allow you to add both text and image watermarks. You can add multiple watermarks to the same document, position them differently, and customize each one independently. Some tools even let you combine text and image watermarks on the same page—for example, a company logo in the corner and a "CONFIDENTIAL" text watermark diagonally across the page. This gives you maximum flexibility for complex branding or protection needs.',
    fv4q: 'What is the maximum file size for adding watermarks to PDFs online?',
    fv4a_pre: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF watermark tools support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files (100+ MB) may cause browser performance issues or timeouts. If you need to watermark very large PDFs, consider splitting them first using a ',
    fv4a_link1: 'PDF splitter tool',
    fv4a_mid: ', watermarking each section, then merging them back together with a ',
    fv4a_link2: 'PDF merger tool',
    fv4a_post: '.',
    fv5q: 'Do I need to create an account to add watermarks to PDF files?',
    fv5a: 'No, many free PDF watermark tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, watermark, and download your documents immediately without signing up. This makes the process faster and more private. Some tools offer optional accounts for saving watermark templates or accessing premium features, but basic PDF watermarking is typically available without any registration.',
    fv6q: 'Can I customize the watermark position and appearance?',
    fv6a: 'Yes, most PDF watermark tools offer extensive customization options. You can position watermarks in the center, corners, diagonally, or at custom coordinates. You can also adjust opacity (transparency), rotation angle, font size (for text watermarks), color, and scale to match your branding needs. Some tools even offer preset templates for common use cases like "DRAFT," "CONFIDENTIAL," or "SAMPLE." The level of customization varies by tool, but most provide enough options to create professional-looking watermarks.',
    fv7q: 'Can I add watermarks to specific pages only?',
    fv7a: 'Yes, advanced PDF watermark tools allow you to specify which pages should receive the watermark. You can watermark all pages, specific page ranges (e.g., "1-5" or "10, 15, 20"), or individual pages. This is useful when you want to protect certain sections while leaving others unmarked, or when you only want to brand the cover page. Some tools also support watermarking even or odd pages only, though this is less common.',
    fv8q: 'Will adding a watermark reduce PDF file quality?',
    fv8a: "No, properly adding a watermark should not reduce the quality of your PDF content. Quality watermark tools overlay the watermark as a separate layer without re-compressing or degrading the original document. This means your PDF maintains its original quality, images stay sharp, and text remains crisp. However, if you're using a tool that converts PDFs to images and back, quality loss can occur. Look for tools that add watermarks at the native PDF level rather than converting formats.",
    fv9q: 'Can I remove a watermark after adding it?',
    fv9a: 'This depends on how the watermark was added. If the watermark was added as a separate layer (which most quality tools do), it may be possible to remove it using specialized PDF editing software, though this requires technical knowledge. However, if the watermark was "burned in" or flattened into the document content, removal becomes much more difficult and may require image editing. For maximum protection, some tools offer options to flatten watermarks, making them part of the document content and harder to remove. Keep a copy of your original unwatermarked PDF if you think you might need to make changes later.',
    fv10q: "What's the best opacity for a watermark?",
    fv10a: 'The best opacity depends on your purpose. For text watermarks like "DRAFT" or "CONFIDENTIAL," 20-40% opacity is typically ideal—visible enough to serve its purpose but not so prominent it obscures content. For image watermarks like logos, 30-60% opacity often works well. For maximum protection (making it harder to remove), you might go slightly higher (40-50% for text, 50-70% for images), but be careful not to make the document hard to read. Most tools offer a preview feature so you can see how different opacity levels look before finalizing. Start with a lower opacity and increase if needed.',
    fv11q: 'Can I watermark password-protected PDFs?',
    fv11a_pre: "This depends on the tool. Most online PDF watermark tools cannot process password-protected PDFs because they can't access the content without the password. You'll need to remove password protection first using a ",
    fv11a_link: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv11a_post: ' or the software that created the protection, then watermark the unlocked files. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password, but this is less common in online tools.',
    fv12q: 'What image formats work best for image watermarks?',
    fv12a: 'PNG format with a transparent background works best for image watermarks because it allows the watermark to overlay content without blocking it with a solid background. JPG files can work but may have white backgrounds that obscure content. SVG files are also excellent for logos and simple graphics, as they scale without quality loss. For best results, use PNG files with transparency, ensure the image is high enough resolution (at least 300 DPI for print-quality documents), and keep file sizes reasonable (under 2 MB for the watermark image itself).',
    fv13q: 'Can I add watermarks to PDFs on mobile devices?',
    fv13a: 'Yes, many online PDF watermark tools work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large watermarks or complex documents might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller files (under 10 MB), fewer total pages (under 50), and simpler watermarks (text rather than complex images). The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens, but core functionality should work.',

    s7h: 'Conclusion: Making PDF Watermarking Simple and Effective',
    s7p1: "Adding watermarks to PDF files doesn't have to be complicated. With modern online PDF watermark tools, protecting and branding your documents is straightforward, fast, and secure. Whether you're a business professional marking confidential reports, a content creator branding your work, or anyone who regularly needs to protect or identify PDF documents, the right tool makes all the difference.",
    s7p2: 'The key advantages of online PDF watermark tools—no installation, privacy-first processing, free access, extensive customization, and cross-platform compatibility—make them the ideal solution for most watermarking needs. While desktop software has its place for advanced batch processing or very large files, simple watermarking is perfectly handled by browser-based tools.',
    s7p3: 'Remember these best practices:',
    s7l1: 'Choose the right watermark type for your needs (text for simple marks, image for branding)',
    s7l2: 'Find the right opacity balance—visible but not intrusive',
    s7l3: 'Use diagonal positioning for protection, corner positioning for logos',
    s7l4: 'Keep individual files under 25 MB for best performance',
    s7l5: 'Use privacy-first tools that process files locally',
    s7l6: 'Preview watermarks before applying to the entire document',
