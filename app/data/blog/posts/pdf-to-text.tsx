    faqVisibleH: 'Frequently Asked Questions About PDF to Text Conversion',

    // Visible FAQ (12) — some answers contain inline links, handled in JSX
    fv1q: 'How do I convert PDF to text online for free?',
    fv1aA: 'You can convert PDF to text online for free by using our ',
    fv1aLink: 'PDF to text converter tool',
    fv1aB: '. Simply upload your PDF file, and the tool will extract all text content automatically. You can then copy the text or download it as a .txt file. No account creation, payment, or software installation required. The process works for both text-based PDFs and scanned documents using OCR technology.',
    fv2q: 'Is it safe to convert PDF to text online?',
    fv2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF to text converter that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All text extraction happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your PDFs are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them.',
    fv3q: 'Can I extract text from scanned PDFs?',
    fv3a: 'Yes, many modern PDF to text converters support OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology that can extract text from scanned PDFs and image-based documents. However, the accuracy depends on the quality of the scan, the clarity of the text, and the OCR engine used. For best results, use high-resolution scans with clear text and good contrast. Handwritten text or very stylized fonts may have lower accuracy rates.',
    fv4q: 'What is the maximum file size for PDF to text conversion?',
    fv4aA: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF to text converters support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files (100+ MB) may cause browser performance issues or timeouts. If you need to extract text from very large PDFs, consider splitting the file first using our ',
    fv4aLink: 'PDF splitter tool',
    fv4aB: ', or using desktop software designed for heavy-duty processing.',
    fv5q: 'Do I need to create an account to convert PDF to text?',
    fv5a: 'No, many free PDF to text converter tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, convert, and download your extracted text immediately without signing up. This makes the process faster and more private. Some tools offer optional accounts for saving conversion history or accessing premium features, but basic PDF to text conversion is typically available without any registration.',
    fv6q: 'Will the extracted text preserve formatting?',
    fv6aA: 'Most PDF to text converters extract plain text without preserving complex formatting like fonts, colors, or layouts. However, basic structure like line breaks and paragraphs are usually maintained. For formatted text extraction, you may need to convert to Word format instead using our ',
    fv6aLink: 'PDF to Word converter',
    fv6aB: '. Tables and complex layouts may require manual cleanup after extraction.',
    fv7q: 'Can I extract text from password-protected PDFs?',
    fv7aA: 'Most online PDF to text converters cannot process password-protected PDFs because they cannot access the content without the password. You will need to remove password protection first using a ',
    fv7aLink: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv7aB: ' or the software that created the protection, then extract the text from the unlocked file. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password.',
    fv8q: 'How accurate is OCR text extraction?',
    fv8a: 'OCR accuracy depends on several factors: scan quality, text clarity, font type, document language, and the OCR engine used. For high-quality scans with clear, printed text, modern OCR can achieve 95-99% accuracy. Lower quality scans, handwritten text, or stylized fonts will have lower accuracy. Always review and proofread OCR-extracted text, especially for important documents. Some tools allow you to select the OCR language for better accuracy with non-English documents.',
    fv9q: 'Can I extract text from specific pages only?',
    fv9a: 'Yes, many PDF to text converters allow you to specify page ranges for extraction. You can extract text from all pages, specific pages (e.g., pages 1-10), or individual pages. This is useful when you only need text from certain sections of a large document, saving processing time and making the output more focused.',
    fv10q: 'What file format is the extracted text saved in?',
    fv10a: 'Most PDF to text converters save extracted text as plain text files (.txt format). This is the most universal format that can be opened in any text editor, word processor, or application. Some tools may also offer options to save as .docx, .rtf, or other formats, but .txt is the standard for text extraction. You can always open the .txt file in Word or another program and save it in a different format if needed.',
    fv11q: 'Can I convert PDF to text on mobile devices?',
    fv11a: 'Yes, many online PDF to text converter tools work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large files or OCR processing might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller files (under 10 MB) and text-based PDFs rather than scanned documents. The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens.',
    fv12q: 'What languages are supported for OCR?',
    fv12a: 'Most modern OCR engines support multiple languages, including major languages like English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and many others. Some tools allow you to select the document language for better OCR accuracy. For documents with multiple languages, you may need to process different sections separately or use a tool that supports multi-language OCR.',

    fq1q: 'How do I convert PDF to text online for free?',
    fq1a: 'You can convert PDF to text online for free by using our PDF to text converter tool. Simply upload your PDF file, and the tool will extract all text content automatically. You can then copy the text or download it as a .txt file. No account creation or software installation required.',
    fq2q: 'Is it safe to convert PDF to text online?',
    fq2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF to text converter that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All text extraction happens client-side, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private.',
    fq3q: 'Can I extract text from scanned PDFs?',
    fq3a: 'Yes, many modern PDF to text converters support OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology that can extract text from scanned PDFs and image-based documents. However, the accuracy depends on the quality of the scan and the OCR engine used.',
    fq4q: 'What is the maximum file size for PDF to text conversion?',
    fq4a: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF to text converters support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files may cause browser performance issues.',
    fq5q: 'Do I need to create an account to convert PDF to text?',
    fq5a: 'No, many free PDF to text converter tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, convert, and download your extracted text immediately without signing up.',
    fq6q: 'Will the extracted text preserve formatting?',
    fq6a: 'Most PDF to text converters extract plain text without preserving complex formatting like fonts, colors, or layouts. However, basic structure like line breaks and paragraphs are usually maintained. For formatted text extraction, you may need specialized tools or convert to Word format instead.',
    fq7q: 'Can I extract text from password-protected PDFs?',
    fq7a: 'Most online PDF to text converters cannot process password-protected PDFs because they cannot access the content without the password. You will need to remove password protection first using a PDF editing tool, then extract the text from the unlocked file.',
