    fv1a2: '. Simply upload your PDF file, choose your page number format and position (top, bottom, left, or right), customize the style, and click add. The tool adds page numbers to all pages that you can download instantly. No account creation, payment, or software installation required.',
    fv2q: 'Is it safe to add page numbers to PDFs online?',
    fv2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF page numbering tool that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All processing happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your PDFs are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them.',
    fv3q: 'Can I customize the page number format and style?',
    fv3a: 'Yes, most online PDF page numbering tools allow you to customize the format (1, 2, 3 or Page 1, Page 2, etc.), position (top, bottom, left, right, or corners), font size, font style, and color. Some tools also let you start numbering from a specific page or use different formats for different sections. Advanced options may include Roman numerals for introductory pages, custom prefixes, or "Page X of Y" formats that show total page count.',
    fv4q: 'What is the maximum file size for adding page numbers to PDFs online?',
    fv4a1: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF page numbering tools support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files (100+ MB) may cause browser performance issues or timeouts. If you need to add page numbers to very large PDFs, consider splitting the file first using a ',
    fv4aLink: 'PDF splitter tool',
    fv4a2: ', or using desktop software designed for heavy-duty processing.',
    fv5q: 'Do I need to create an account to add page numbers to PDF files?',
    fv5a: 'No, many free PDF page numbering tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, add page numbers, and download your numbered PDF files immediately without signing up. This makes the process faster and more private. Some tools offer optional accounts for saving numbering history or accessing premium features, but basic PDF page numbering is typically available without any registration.',
    fv6q: 'Can I start page numbering from a specific page?',
    fv6a: 'Yes, many PDF page numbering tools allow you to specify which page to start numbering from. For example, you can skip the cover page and title page, starting page numbers from page 3. You can also set a custom starting number (e.g., start from page 10 if this document continues from another). Some tools even let you exclude specific pages from numbering or use different numbering styles for different sections of your document.',
    fv7q: 'Will adding page numbers reduce PDF file quality?',
    fv7a: "No, properly adding page numbers to a PDF should not reduce quality. Quality tools add page numbers as text or vector elements without re-compressing or degrading the existing content. The PDF maintains the same quality as the original. However, if you're using a tool that converts PDFs to images and back, quality loss can occur. Look for tools that add page numbers at the native PDF level rather than converting formats.",
    fv8q: 'Can I add page numbers to password-protected PDFs?',
    fv8a1: 'This depends on the tool. Most online PDF page numbering tools cannot process password-protected PDFs because they cannot access the content without the password. You will need to remove password protection first using a ',
    fv8aLink: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv8a2: ' or the software that created the protection, then add page numbers to the unlocked file. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password.',
    fv9q: 'Can I use different page number formats for different sections?',
    fv9a: "This depends on the tool's capabilities. Basic online tools typically apply one format to all pages. However, some advanced tools allow you to set different formats for different page ranges. For example, you might use Roman numerals (i, ii, iii) for introductory pages and Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) for the main content. This may require multiple passes with the tool or using more sophisticated desktop software.",
    fv10q: 'What happens to the original PDF after adding page numbers?',
    fv10a: "The original PDF file on your device remains completely unchanged. Adding page numbers creates a new file with numbers added, without modifying the source document. This means you can add page numbers multiple times using different formats or settings without any risk to your original file. Always keep backups of important original files until you're satisfied with the numbered version.",
    fv11q: 'Can I add page numbers to PDFs on mobile devices?',
    fv11a: 'Yes, many online PDF page numbering tools work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large files might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller files (under 10 MB) and fewer total pages (under 50). The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens, but core functionality should work.',
    fv12q: 'Can I remove page numbers if I make a mistake?',
    fv12a: "Since adding page numbers creates a new file, you can't \"undo\" in the traditional sense. However, your original PDF file remains unchanged on your device, so you can simply add page numbers again with the correct settings. This is why it's important to preview your settings before processing. Some tools keep your settings available for a few minutes after processing, allowing quick re-numbering if needed.",
