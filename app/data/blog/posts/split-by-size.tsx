    intro1: "You've got a 45 MB PDF file that needs to be emailed, but your email service has a 25 MB attachment limit. Or maybe you're trying to upload a large document to a system that only accepts files under 10 MB. These are the moments when you realize that splitting PDFs by size isn't just convenient—it's essential.",
    intro2: 'Splitting PDF files by file size is one of those features that seems simple until you actually need it. Unlike splitting by page ranges where you know exactly which pages you want, splitting by size requires the tool to intelligently divide your document while maintaining quality and ensuring each piece stays within your specified limit. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about splitting PDFs by size, from understanding when and why to use this method to mastering the process with our free online tool.',

    s1h: 'The Problem: When File Size Becomes a Barrier',
    s1p1: "We live in a world full of file size restrictions. Email services cap attachments at 25 MB. Cloud storage platforms have upload limits. Content management systems restrict file sizes. Even file sharing services have their own constraints. When you're working with large PDF documents—whether they're comprehensive reports, scanned archives, or multi-page presentations—these limitations can bring your workflow to a grinding halt.",
    s1p2: "Here's what makes large PDF files problematic:",
    s1l1a: 'Email attachment limits:',
    s1l1b: ' Most email providers restrict attachments to 25 MB, with some corporate systems limiting to 10 MB or less',

    s1l6b: ' Sending or receiving very large files can consume significant bandwidth, especially problematic for users on limited data plans',
    s1p3: 'The traditional workaround—manually splitting by guessing page counts—is tedious and error-prone. You might split a 100-page PDF into 20-page chunks, only to discover that some chunks are still too large because certain pages contain high-resolution images or complex graphics. Or you might create unnecessarily small files, resulting in dozens of separate documents that are difficult to manage.',
    s1p4: "That's where splitting by file size comes in. Instead of guessing how many pages equal a certain file size, you tell the tool exactly what size limit you need, and it intelligently divides your PDF accordingly. This ensures every split file stays within your limit while maximizing the content in each file.",

    s5h: 'Benefits of Splitting PDFs by Size',
    s5p1: 'Why choose size-based splitting over other methods? Here are the key advantages that make this approach ideal for many use cases:',

    s5s1h: '1. Guaranteed Compatibility with Size Limits',
    s5s1p1: "The biggest advantage is certainty. When you split by size, you know with 100% confidence that every file will stay under your specified limit. There's no guessing, no trial and error, no bounced emails or failed uploads. You set the limit, and the tool ensures compliance.",

    s5s2h: '2. Optimal File Sizing',
    s5s2p1: 'Size-based splitting maximizes content in each file while respecting your limit. Unlike manual page-based splitting where you might create unnecessarily small files, the tool groups pages intelligently to get as close to your limit as possible without exceeding it.',
    s5s2p2: 'For example, if you have a 50 MB PDF and set a 10 MB limit, you\'ll get 5 files of approximately 10 MB each. If you split by pages manually, you might end up with 8 files of varying sizes, some much smaller than necessary.',

    s5s3h: '3. Handles Variable Page Sizes Automatically',
    s5s3p1: "PDFs aren't uniform—some pages are text-heavy (small file size), while others contain high-resolution images or complex graphics (large file size). When you split by page count, you might create files with wildly different sizes.",
    s5s3p2: 'Size-based splitting accounts for this automatically. A file might contain 15 text pages or 3 image-heavy pages—the tool adjusts to keep file sizes consistent, which is exactly what you need for email or upload compatibility.',

    s5s4h: '4. Perfect for Email Attachments',
    s5s4p1: 'Email attachment limits are the most common reason people need to split PDFs by size. With size-based splitting, you can confidently split any document to meet email requirements. Set your limit to 10 MB or 20 MB (depending on your email provider), and every file will be ready to send without worrying about bounce-backs or delivery failures.',

    s5s5h: '5. No Quality Loss',
    s5s5p1: 'Unlike compression (which reduces quality to reduce size), splitting by size simply divides your document. Each split file maintains the exact same quality as the original pages. There\'s no re-compression, no quality degradation, no loss of detail.',
    s5s5p2: 'This is crucial for professional documents, legal files, medical records, or any content where quality preservation is important. You get smaller files without sacrificing quality.',

    s5s6h: '6. Flexible Size Limits',
    s5s6p1: 'Different platforms have different requirements. Email might need 10 MB files, while a content management system might allow 50 MB. With size-based splitting, you can easily adjust your limit to match any requirement. One tool handles all scenarios.',

    s5s7h: '7. Time Savings',
    s5s7p1: 'Manual splitting methods require you to:',
    s5s7l1: 'Estimate how many pages equal your desired file size',
    s5s7l2: "Test split files to verify they're under limits",
    s5s7l3: 'Adjust and re-split if files are too large',

    s5s7p2: 'Size-based splitting eliminates all of this. You set the limit once, and the tool handles everything automatically. What might take 30 minutes of trial and error becomes a 2-minute automated process.',

    s5s8h: '8. Professional Results',
    s5s8p1: "Consistently sized files look more professional than a mix of large and small files. When you're sending documents to clients, colleagues, or stakeholders, uniform file sizes demonstrate attention to detail and technical competence. Size-based splitting ensures every file meets your standards.",

    faqVisH: 'Frequently Asked Questions About Splitting PDFs by Size',

    // Visible FAQ (13)
    fv1q: 'How do I split a PDF by file size?',
    fv1a: 'You can split a PDF by file size using our online PDF splitter tool. Simply upload your PDF file, select the "Split by Size" option, specify your desired maximum file size (e.g., 5 MB, 10 MB), and click split. The tool automatically divides your PDF into multiple files, each under your specified size limit. No account creation or payment required.',
    fv2q: 'Why would I need to split a PDF by size?',
    fv2a: 'Splitting PDFs by size is essential when you need to email large documents (most email services have 25 MB limits), upload files to systems with size restrictions, or optimize file sizes for faster sharing. It ensures each split file stays within your specified size limit while maintaining document quality. This is especially important for professional communication, client deliverables, and compliance with platform requirements.',
    fv3q: 'What is the best file size to split a PDF into?',
    fv3a: 'The best file size depends on your needs. For email attachments, 5-10 MB is ideal since most email services limit attachments to 25 MB, and staying well under the limit ensures reliable delivery. For cloud storage or file sharing, 10-20 MB works well. For very large documents, splitting into 5 MB chunks ensures maximum compatibility across different platforms. Consider your recipient\'s system and your specific use case when choosing a size limit.',
    fv4q: 'Does splitting a PDF by size reduce quality?',
    fv4a: 'No, splitting a PDF by size does not reduce quality. The tool divides your PDF at page boundaries, extracting pages without re-compressing or degrading content. Each split file maintains the same quality as the original pages. The tool intelligently groups pages to stay within your size limit while preserving all original content, formatting, and image quality.',
    fv5q: 'Can I split a PDF by size for free?',
    fv5a: 'Yes, you can split PDFs by size completely free using our online tool. No account creation, payment, or software installation required. Simply upload your PDF, set your size limit, and download the split files. All processing happens in your browser for maximum privacy and security. Your files never leave your device.',
    fv6q: 'How many files will I get when splitting by size?',
    fv6a: "The number of files depends on your original PDF size and your specified size limit. For example, a 50 MB PDF split at 10 MB will create approximately 5 files. A 25 MB PDF split at 5 MB will create about 5 files. The tool automatically calculates how many files are needed and splits at page boundaries to maintain document integrity. You'll see a preview before splitting showing the expected number of files.",
    fv7q: 'Is it safe to split PDFs by size online?',
    fv7a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF splitter that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All splitting happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your PDFs are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them.',
    fv8q: 'What is the maximum file size I can split?',
    fv8a1: 'Most online PDF splitters support files up to 25-50 MB for optimal performance. Very large files (100+ MB) may cause browser performance issues or timeouts. For best results, keep files under 25 MB. If you have larger files, consider using our ',
    fv8link: 'PDF compression tool',
    fv8a2: ' first to reduce size before splitting. This two-step approach (compress then split) works well for very large documents.',
    fv9q: 'Can I split password-protected PDFs by size?',
    fv9a1: "Most online PDF splitters cannot process password-protected PDFs because they can't access the content without the password. You'll need to remove password protection first using a ",
    fv9link: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv9a2: ' or the software that created the protection, then split the unlocked files. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password during processing.',
    fv10q: 'Will the split files have the same page sizes and formatting?',
    fv10a: 'Yes, all split files maintain the exact same page sizes, orientations, formatting, fonts, images, and layout as the original PDF. The tool extracts pages without modification, so each split file looks identical to the corresponding pages in the original document. The only difference is that content is divided across multiple files instead of one.',
    fv11q: 'Can I choose a custom file size limit?',
    fv11a: 'Yes, most tools let you specify any file size limit you need. Common options include 1 MB, 5 MB, 10 MB, 15 MB, 20 MB, 25 MB, and 50 MB, but many tools also support custom values. Simply enter your desired size in MB (or KB for very precise control). The tool will create as many files as needed to stay under your limit.',
    fv12q: 'What happens if a single page is larger than my size limit?',
    fv12a1: 'If a single page exceeds your size limit (which is rare but possible with very high-resolution images), the tool will still include that page in a file, but that file will exceed your limit. Most tools will warn you about this situation. In such cases, you may need to use our ',
    fv12link1: 'PDF compression tool',
    fv12a2: ' first to reduce the overall file size, then split the compressed PDF. Alternatively, you could use our ',
    fv12link2: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv12a3: ' to optimize individual pages before splitting.',
    fv13q: 'Can I split PDFs by size on mobile devices?',
    fv13a: 'Yes, many online PDF splitter tools work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large splits might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller files (under 10 MB) and fewer total pages (under 50). The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens, but core functionality should work.',

    s8h: 'Conclusion: Mastering PDF Size-Based Splitting',
    s8p1: "Splitting PDF files by size is one of those features that transforms a frustrating limitation into a simple, automated process. Whether you're dealing with email attachment limits, upload restrictions, or file sharing constraints, size-based splitting ensures your documents can be delivered and accessed exactly when and where they're needed.",
    s8p2: 'The key advantages of size-based splitting—guaranteed size compliance, optimal file sizing, quality preservation, and time savings—make it the ideal solution for most professional workflows. Unlike manual methods that require trial and error, or compression that sacrifices quality, splitting by size gives you exactly what you need: perfectly sized files that maintain original quality.',
    s8p3: 'Remember these best practices:',
    s8l1: 'Choose your size limit based on your specific needs (email limits, upload restrictions, etc.)',
    s8l2: 'Stay 1-2 MB under strict limits to account for email encoding overhead',
    s8l3: 'For very large PDFs, consider compressing first, then splitting for optimal results',
    s8l4: 'Use descriptive file naming to help recipients understand what they\'re receiving',
    s8l5: 'Download split files as a ZIP archive when creating many files for easier management',
    s8l6: "Keep backups of original files until you're satisfied with the splits",

    fq1q: 'How do I split a PDF by file size?',
    fq1a: 'You can split a PDF by file size using our online PDF splitter tool. Simply upload your PDF file, select the "Split by Size" option, specify your desired maximum file size (e.g., 5 MB, 10 MB), and click split. The tool automatically divides your PDF into multiple files, each under your specified size limit.',
    fq2q: 'Why would I need to split a PDF by size?',
    fq2a: 'Splitting PDFs by size is essential when you need to email large documents (most email services have 25 MB limits), upload files to systems with size restrictions, or optimize file sizes for faster sharing. It ensures each split file stays within your specified size limit while maintaining document quality.',
    fq3q: 'What is the best file size to split a PDF into?',
    fq3a: 'The best file size depends on your needs. For email attachments, 5-10 MB is ideal since most email services limit attachments to 25 MB. For cloud storage or file sharing, 10-20 MB works well. For very large documents, splitting into 5 MB chunks ensures maximum compatibility across different platforms.',
