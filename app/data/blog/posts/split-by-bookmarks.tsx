    intro1: "You've got a 300-page technical manual, a comprehensive research report, or a multi-chapter e-book. The document is well-organized with bookmarks—those clickable navigation links in the sidebar that let you jump between sections. But now you need to split it into separate files, one for each chapter or section. Manually selecting page ranges would take forever and be prone to errors. There has to be a better way.",
    intro2: "There is. Splitting PDFs by bookmarks is one of those features that feels like magic when you first use it. Instead of painstakingly figuring out which pages belong to which section, you let the PDF's own organizational structure do the work. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about splitting PDFs by bookmarks—from understanding what bookmarks are to mastering the technique for your specific needs.",

    s1h: 'The Problem: Why Manual PDF Splitting Is So Frustrating',
    s1p1: "Let's say you have a 200-page company handbook with 15 distinct sections. Each section covers a different policy area—HR policies, IT guidelines, safety procedures, and so on. Your boss wants you to create separate PDF files for each section so they can be distributed to different departments or uploaded to different parts of the company intranet.",
    s1p2: 'The manual approach goes something like this: Open the PDF, scroll through to find where each section starts and ends, note the page numbers, then use a PDF splitter to extract those specific page ranges. For 15 sections, that\'s 15 separate operations. Each one requires you to:',

    s1l4: 'Repeat the process for every section',
    s1l5: "Double-check that you didn't miss any pages or include wrong ones",
    s1p3: "This process is not just time-consuming—it's error-prone. You might accidentally include a page from the next section, or miss the last page of a section. If the document gets updated and page numbers shift, you have to start over. And if you're dealing with a document that has dozens of sections, the manual approach becomes completely impractical.",
    s1p4: "The real kicker? Most PDFs already have this organizational information built right in—it's called bookmarks, or PDF outlines. They're the navigation structure that appears in the sidebar of PDF readers. The problem is that most people don't realize they can use this existing structure to automate the splitting process entirely.",

    s3p2: "PDF bookmarks—also called PDF outlines or the document's table of contents—are navigational elements embedded in PDF files. When you open a PDF in a reader like Adobe Acrobat or your browser's PDF viewer, you'll often see a sidebar panel (usually on the left) that shows a clickable outline of the document's structure. Click on a bookmark, and you jump directly to that section.",

    s5s1h: '1. Automatic and Accurate',
    s5s1p: "The biggest advantage is automation. You don't need to manually identify section boundaries or count pages. The bookmark structure already contains this information, so the tool can split accurately without any guesswork. This eliminates human error—no accidentally including pages from the wrong section or missing the last page of a chapter.",
    s5s2h: '2. Respects Document Structure',
    s5s2p: "When you split by bookmarks, you're using the document's own organizational logic. The person who created the PDF already decided how to structure it—bookmarks reflect those decisions. By splitting at bookmark boundaries, you maintain the intended document organization rather than imposing an arbitrary page-based division.",
    s5s3h: '3. Scalable to Any Number of Sections',
    s5s3p: "Whether your document has 3 sections or 300, bookmark-based splitting handles it with the same ease. There's no difference in effort between splitting a 5-chapter book and a 50-section manual. This scalability makes it perfect for large, complex documents that would be impractical to split manually.",
    s5s4h: '4. Meaningful File Names',
    s5s4p: 'When splitting by bookmarks, the resulting files are typically named after the bookmark titles. Instead of generic names like "split_001.pdf" and "split_002.pdf", you get descriptive names like "Chapter_1_Introduction.pdf" and "Chapter_2_Methodology.pdf". This makes it much easier to identify and organize the split files later.',
    s5s5h: '5. Flexible Granularity Control',
    s5s5p: 'The ability to choose bookmark levels gives you control over how granular your splits are. Need broad divisions? Split at level 1. Need detailed separation? Split at level 2 or 3. This flexibility lets you adapt the splitting to your specific workflow needs without having to manually adjust page ranges.',
    s5s6h: '6. Fast and Efficient',
    s5s6p: 'What might take an hour of manual work can be completed in under a minute with bookmark-based splitting. The tool processes everything automatically, so you can split complex documents in the time it takes to make a cup of coffee. This time savings becomes even more valuable when you need to split documents regularly.',
    s5s7h: '7. Maintains Document Quality',
    s5s7p: "Splitting by bookmarks preserves the original document's formatting, images, and structure. Each split file maintains the same quality as the original pages, with no degradation or compression artifacts. This is especially important for professional documents where quality matters.",
    s5s8h: '8. Reusable Process',
    s5s8p: 'If the source document gets updated (new version with same bookmark structure), you can re-split it using the same bookmark level. The process is consistent and repeatable, making it ideal for documents that are regularly updated and need to be re-split.',

    fv2a: 'PDF bookmarks, also known as PDF outlines or table of contents, are navigational elements embedded in PDF files. They appear in the bookmarks panel of PDF readers (usually a sidebar) and allow users to jump to specific sections. Bookmarks contain structural information including section titles, page references, and hierarchical relationships. When splitting by bookmarks, each bookmark section becomes a separate PDF file.',
    fv3q: "Can I split a PDF by bookmarks if it doesn't have bookmarks?",
    fv3a: 'No, you need a PDF with bookmarks to use the split by bookmarks feature. If your PDF doesn\'t have bookmarks, you have a few options: add bookmarks first using a PDF editing tool like our PDF editing tool, use alternative splitting methods like splitting by page ranges or file size, or use OCR software to add structure to scanned PDFs.',
    fv3linkText: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv4q: 'Is it safe to split PDFs by bookmarks online?',
    fv4a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF splitter that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All splitting happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private throughout the process. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your PDFs are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them.',
    fv5q: 'What is a bookmark level in PDF splitting?',
    fv5a: 'Bookmark levels refer to the hierarchical structure of bookmarks in a PDF. Level 1 bookmarks are top-level sections (like main chapters), level 2 bookmarks are subsections within level 1 (like sections within chapters), and so on. When splitting by bookmarks, you choose which level to split at. For example, splitting at level 1 creates one file per main chapter, while splitting at level 2 creates files for each subsection. This gives you control over the granularity of your splits.',
    fv6q: 'Can I split a PDF by bookmarks for free?',
    fv6a: 'Yes, our PDF split by bookmarks tool is completely free to use. No account creation, payment, or software installation required. Simply upload your PDF, select your bookmark level, and download the split files. All processing happens in your browser, so there are no subscription fees or usage limits.',
    fv7q: 'How many files will I get when splitting by bookmarks?',
    fv7a: 'The number of files depends on how many bookmarks exist at the level you choose to split at. If you split at level 1 and your PDF has 10 level 1 bookmarks, you\'ll get 10 files. If you split at level 2 and there are 25 level 2 bookmarks, you\'ll get 25 files. The tool shows you how many files will be created before you split, so you can adjust the bookmark level if needed.',
    fv8q: 'Will splitting by bookmarks reduce file quality?',
    fv8a: 'No, properly splitting a PDF by bookmarks should not reduce quality. The tool extracts pages at the native PDF level without re-compressing or degrading the content. Each split PDF maintains the same quality as the original pages, preserving images, text, and formatting exactly as they appear in the source document.',
    fv9q: 'Can I split password-protected PDFs by bookmarks?',
    fv9a: "Most online PDF splitters cannot process password-protected PDFs because they can't access the content without the password. You'll need to remove password protection first using a PDF editing tool or the software that created the protection, then split the unlocked file by bookmarks. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password.",
    fv9linkText: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv10q: 'What happens if my PDF has nested bookmarks?',
    fv10a: 'Nested bookmarks (bookmarks with multiple levels) work perfectly with bookmark-based splitting. You simply choose which level to split at. If you have a document with chapters (level 1) containing sections (level 2) containing subsections (level 3), you can split at any of these levels. Splitting at level 1 gives you one file per chapter, level 2 gives you one file per section, and level 3 gives you one file per subsection.',
    fv11q: 'Can I split PDFs by bookmarks on mobile devices?',
    fv11a: 'Yes, many online PDF splitter tools work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large PDFs with many bookmarks might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller files (under 10 MB) and documents with fewer bookmarks (under 20). The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens.',
    fv12q: 'What if my bookmark titles have special characters?',
    fv12a: "The tool automatically sanitizes bookmark titles when creating file names, removing or replacing special characters that aren't valid in filenames. This ensures all split files have valid, usable names regardless of what characters appear in the original bookmark titles. You can always rename the files after downloading if needed.",

    fq1q: 'How do I split a PDF by bookmarks?',
    fq1a: 'You can split a PDF by bookmarks using our free online tool.

                    No, you need a PDF with bookmarks to use the split by bookmarks feature. If your PDF doesn't have bookmarks, you have a few options: add bookmarks first using a PDF editing tool like our <Link href={L('/edit')} className="text-primary-400 hover:text-primary-300 underline">{c.fv3linkText}</Link>, use alternative splitting methods like splitting by page ranges or file size, or use OCR software to add structure to scanned PDFs.

                    Most online PDF splitters cannot process password-protected PDFs because they can't access the content without the password. You'll need to remove password protection first using a <Link href={L('/edit')} className="text-primary-400 hover:text-primary-300 underline">{c.fv9linkText}</Link> or the software that created the protection, then split the unlocked file by bookmarks. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password.
