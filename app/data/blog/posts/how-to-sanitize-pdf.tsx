    intro1: "You're about to share a PDF document—maybe it's a contract, a report, or a presentation. You've reviewed the visible content and everything looks good. But here's the thing: PDF files contain far more information than what you see on the screen. Hidden metadata, embedded files, JavaScript code, document history, and other invisible data can reveal more about you and your document than you might realize.",
    intro2: "PDF sanitization is the process of cleaning these hidden elements from your documents before sharing them. It's like removing the metadata tags from a photo before posting it online—you keep the visible content but strip away the invisible information that could compromise your privacy or security. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about sanitizing PDFs, from understanding what hidden data exists to using modern tools that clean your documents safely and effectively.",

    s1h: "The Problem: What's Hiding in Your PDF Files",
    s1p1: "When you create or edit a PDF file, your software embeds a surprising amount of information that isn't visible when you view the document. This hidden data can include:",
    s1l1s: 'Document metadata:',
    s1l1t: " Your name, company name, creation date, modification dates, software used, and even your computer's name",
    s1l2s: 'JavaScript code:',
    s1l2t: ' Interactive scripts that can execute when the PDF is opened, potentially posing security risks',
    s1l3s: 'Embedded files and attachments:',
    s1l3t: ' Other documents, images, or files hidden within the PDF structure',
    s1l4s: 'Annotations and comments:',
    s1l4t: ' Review comments, highlights, and notes that might contain sensitive information',
    s1l5s: 'Form field data:',
    s1l5t: ' Information entered into interactive forms, even if the form appears blank',
    s1l6s: 'Hidden layers:',

    s1l8s: 'Previous versions:',
    s1l8t: ' Traces of earlier document versions that were edited or merged',
    s1p2: 'This hidden information can reveal more than you intend. For example, metadata might show that you created a document at 2 AM on a Sunday, or that you used specific software that reveals your organization\'s tools. JavaScript code could potentially execute malicious actions when recipients open the PDF. Embedded files might contain sensitive documents you thought you removed.',
    s1p3: "The challenge is that most PDF viewers don't show this hidden information by default. You can't see it when you open the file normally, but anyone with the right tools can extract it. This is why PDF sanitization has become essential for anyone who shares documents containing sensitive information, works with confidential data, or simply values their privacy.",

    s2p2: 'Beyond privacy concerns, unsanitized PDFs can pose security risks. JavaScript code embedded in PDFs has been used in phishing attacks and malware distribution. Recipients who open these PDFs might unknowingly execute malicious scripts. Embedded files could contain viruses or malware. Even seemingly harmless metadata can be used for social engineering attacks.',

    faqVisH: 'Frequently Asked Questions About PDF Sanitization',
    // Visible FAQ (13)
    fv1q: 'What does it mean to sanitize a PDF file?',
    fv1a: "Sanitizing a PDF means removing hidden data, metadata, JavaScript code, embedded files, annotations, form data, and other sensitive information that could expose personal details, document history, or security risks. The sanitized PDF contains only the visible content without any hidden elements. It's like cleaning a document to remove invisible information that could compromise privacy or security.",
    fv2q: 'Is it safe to sanitize PDFs online?',
    fv2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF sanitizer that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All sanitization happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private throughout the process. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your PDFs are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them.',
    fv3q: 'What information is removed when sanitizing a PDF?',
    fv3a: 'PDF sanitization removes document metadata (author name, creation date, modification dates, software used, computer name), JavaScript code and interactive scripts, embedded files and attachments, annotations and comments, form field data, hidden layers, hyperlinks and cross-references, and other hidden content. The visible content—text, images, formatting, and layout—remains completely intact. Only hidden data is removed.',
    fv4q: 'Will sanitizing a PDF reduce file quality?',
    fv4a: "No, properly sanitizing a PDF should not reduce the quality of visible content. The sanitization process removes hidden data and metadata while preserving the actual document content, images, and formatting. Your sanitized PDF will look identical to the original, just without hidden information. However, if you're using a tool that converts PDFs to images and back, quality loss can occur. Look for tools that sanitize PDFs at the native PDF level rather than converting formats.",
    fv5q: 'Do I need to create an account to sanitize PDFs?',
    fv5a: 'No, many free PDF sanitizer tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, sanitize, and download your cleaned PDF files immediately without signing up. This makes the process faster and more private. Some tools offer optional accounts for saving sanitization history or accessing premium features, but basic PDF sanitization is typically available without any registration.',
    fv6q: 'Can I sanitize password-protected PDFs?',
    fv6a1: "Most online PDF sanitizers cannot process password-protected PDFs because they need access to the content without the password. You'll need to remove password protection first using a ",
    fv6link: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv6a2: ' or the software that created the protection, then sanitize the unlocked file. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password during processing.',
    fv7q: 'Why should I sanitize PDF files before sharing?',
    fv7a: 'Sanitizing PDFs before sharing protects your privacy by removing metadata that could reveal your name, location, software used, creation dates, and document history. It also removes potentially malicious JavaScript code and embedded files that could pose security risks to recipients. This is especially important for legal documents, contracts, medical records, financial information, and any sensitive data. Sanitization helps you comply with privacy regulations and protect both yourself and document recipients.',
    fv8q: 'What is the maximum file size for sanitizing PDFs online?',
    fv8a1: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF sanitizers support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files (100+ MB) may cause browser performance issues or timeouts. If you need to sanitize very large PDFs, consider splitting them first using a ',
    fv8link: 'PDF splitter tool',
    fv8a2: ' or using desktop software designed for heavy-duty processing.',
    fv9q: 'Can I sanitize multiple PDFs at once?',
    fv9a: "This depends on the tool you're using. Some online PDF sanitizers support batch processing, allowing you to sanitize multiple files in one operation. Others process one file at a time. For best results and to avoid browser performance issues, we recommend sanitizing files one at a time, especially if they're large. You can always sanitize multiple files sequentially.",
    fv10q: 'Will sanitizing remove watermarks or visible content?',
    fv10a: 'No, sanitization only removes hidden data, not visible content. Watermarks, text, images, formatting, and all visible elements remain intact. The sanitized PDF will look identical to the original in terms of what you can see. Only invisible metadata, JavaScript, embedded files, and other hidden elements are removed.',
    fv11q: 'Can I undo sanitization if I make a mistake?',
    fv11a: 'Since sanitization creates a new file, you can\'t "undo" the process in the traditional sense. However, your original PDF file remains unchanged on your device, so you can always sanitize it again if needed. This is why it\'s important to keep your original PDF until you\'ve verified that the sanitized version meets your needs. Some tools keep your file available for a few minutes after sanitization, allowing quick re-sanitization if needed.',
    fv12q: 'Is there a difference between sanitizing and redacting PDFs?',

    fv13q: 'Can I sanitize PDFs on mobile devices?',
    fv13a: 'Yes, many online PDF sanitizer tools work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large files might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller files (under 10 MB) and fewer total pages (under 50). The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens, but core functionality should work.',

    s8h: 'Conclusion: Making PDF Sanitization Simple and Secure',
    s8p1: "Sanitizing PDF files doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. With modern online PDF sanitization tools, cleaning hidden data, metadata, and sensitive information from your documents is straightforward, fast, and secure. Whether you're a legal professional sharing case documents, a business executive sending contracts, or anyone who values privacy when sharing PDFs, the right tool makes all the difference.",
    s8p2: 'The key advantages of online PDF sanitizers—privacy-first processing, no installation, free access, comprehensive cleaning, and cross-platform compatibility—make them the ideal solution for most sanitization needs. While desktop software has its place for advanced PDF editing tasks, simple sanitization is perfectly handled by browser-based tools that process files locally on your device.',

    // Schema FAQ (8) — kept distinct from the visible FAQ to preserve the legacy markup
    fq1q: 'What does it mean to sanitize a PDF file?',
    fq1a: 'Sanitizing a PDF means removing hidden data, metadata, JavaScript code, embedded files, annotations, form data, and other sensitive information that could expose personal details, document history, or security risks. The sanitized PDF contains only the visible content without any hidden elements.',
    fq2q: 'Is it safe to sanitize PDFs online?',
    fq2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF sanitizer that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All sanitization happens client-side, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private throughout the process.',
    fq3q: 'What information is removed when sanitizing a PDF?',
    fq3a: 'PDF sanitization removes metadata (author, creation date, software used), JavaScript code, embedded files and attachments, annotations and comments, form field data, hidden layers, hyperlinks, and other hidden content. The visible content and formatting remain intact.',
    fq4q: 'Will sanitizing a PDF reduce file quality?',
    fq4a: 'No, properly sanitizing a PDF should not reduce the quality of visible content. The sanitization process removes hidden data and metadata while preserving the actual document content, images, and formatting. Your sanitized PDF will look identical to the original, just without hidden information.',
    fq5q: 'Do I need to create an account to sanitize PDFs?',
    fq5a: 'No, many free PDF sanitizer tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, sanitize, and download your cleaned PDF files immediately without signing up.',
    fq6q: 'Can I sanitize password-protected PDFs?',
    fq6a: "Most online PDF sanitizers cannot process password-protected PDFs because they need access to the content. You'll need to remove password protection first using a PDF editing tool, then sanitize the unlocked file.",
    fq7q: 'Why should I sanitize PDF files before sharing?',
    fq7a: 'Sanitizing PDFs before sharing protects your privacy by removing metadata that could reveal your name, location, software used, creation dates, and document history. It also removes potentially malicious JavaScript code and embedded files that could pose security risks to recipients.',
    fq8q: 'What is the maximum file size for sanitizing PDFs online?',
    fq8a: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF sanitizers support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files may cause browser performance issues.',
