    st2p2Strong: 'Pro tip:',
    st2p2: " If you're converting scanned documents, make sure they're scanned at a high enough resolution (at least 300 DPI) to ensure text remains readable in the PDF. For photos, most modern smartphone cameras produce images that work perfectly for PDF conversion.",

    st5p2: 'If your tool offers these settings, take a moment to configure them based on your needs. For most use cases, default settings work perfectly, but customizing can help you achieve specific results. For example, if you\'re creating a PDF for printing, you might want to ensure images fit properly on standard page sizes. If file size is a concern, you might adjust compression settings.',

    b3h: '3. Cost-Effective Solution',
    b3p: 'Most online image to PDF converter tools are completely free. Even premium desktop PDF software can cost $100-300, and subscription services charge monthly fees. For occasional or regular image to PDF conversion, free online tools provide excellent value without any financial commitment. You get professional-quality results without spending a dime.',

    b4h: '4. Cross-Platform Compatibility',
    b4p: "Whether you're on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, or Android, online image to PDF converters work everywhere.

You can combine JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and BMP images all in one PDF without needing separate conversion steps. This flexibility means you don't need to worry about format compatibility—just upload your images and let the tool handle the rest.",

    b8h: '8. Easy Image Reordering',

    // Visible FAQ (13)
    fv1q: 'How do I convert images to PDF online for free?',
    fv1a1: 'You can convert images to PDF online for free by using our ',
    fv1aLink: 'image to PDF converter tool',
    fv1a2: '. Simply upload your image files (JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, or BMP), arrange them in your preferred order using drag-and-drop, and click create PDF. The tool combines all images into a single PDF document that you can download instantly. No account creation, payment, or software installation required. The entire process takes just seconds and happens entirely in your browser.',
    fv2q: 'Is it safe to convert images to PDF online?',
    fv2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first image to PDF converter that processes files locally in your browser, your images never leave your device. All conversion happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your photos and documents remain secure and private. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your images are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them. This is especially important when working with personal photos, sensitive documents, or confidential information.',
    fv3q: 'Can I combine multiple images into one PDF?',
    fv3a: 'Absolutely. Most online image to PDF converters allow you to combine multiple images into a single PDF document. You can upload multiple image files at once, arrange them in your preferred order using drag-and-drop, and the tool will create one PDF with all images as separate pages. This is perfect for creating photo albums, document collections, combining scanned pages, or compiling portfolios. There\'s typically no limit on the number of images you can combine, though very large batches (50+ images) may take longer to process.',
    fv4q: 'What image formats can I convert to PDF?',
    fv4a: 'Most online image to PDF converters support common image formats including JPG/JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and BMP. Some tools also support TIFF, HEIC (iPhone photos), and other formats. The most widely supported formats are JPG and PNG, which work with virtually all image to PDF conversion tools. You can typically mix different formats in a single conversion—for example, combining JPG photos with PNG screenshots in one PDF. If you have images in less common formats, check the tool\'s supported formats list or consider converting those images to JPG or PNG first.',
    fv5q: 'What is the maximum file size for converting images to PDF online?',
    fv5a: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online image to PDF converters support files up to 25-50 MB per image. For best performance, keep individual images under 10 MB and limit the total number of images to under 50. Very large images (100+ MB) or too many images may cause browser performance issues or timeouts. If you need to convert very large images, consider resizing them first or using desktop software designed for heavy-duty processing. The total size of all images combined also matters—keeping the total under 100-200 MB typically ensures smooth processing.',
    fv6q: 'Do I need to create an account to convert images to PDF?',
    fv6a: 'No, many free image to PDF converter tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, convert, and download your PDF files immediately without signing up. This makes the process faster and more private. Some tools offer optional accounts for saving conversion history, accessing premium features, or syncing across devices, but basic image to PDF conversion is typically available without any registration. The ability to use the tool anonymously is one of the key advantages of privacy-first online converters.',
    fv7q: 'Will converting images to PDF reduce image quality?',
    fv7a1: "Quality depends on the tool and settings you use. High-quality image to PDF converters preserve the original image quality without compression. However, some tools may compress images to reduce PDF file size. Look for tools that offer quality settings or explicitly state they preserve original image quality. For best results, use tools that maintain the original resolution and don't apply unnecessary compression. If file size is a concern, you can use a ",
    fv7aLink: 'PDF compression tool',
    fv7a2: ' after conversion to reduce size while maintaining acceptable quality. Generally, if your source images are high quality, the PDF will maintain that quality.',
    fv8q: 'Can I convert images to PDF on mobile devices?',
    fv8a: 'Yes, many online image to PDF converters work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large images or many images might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller images (under 5 MB each) and fewer total images (under 20). The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens, but core functionality should work. Mobile conversion is perfect for quick tasks like converting a few photos or combining scanned documents on the go.',
    fv9q: 'Can I reorder images after uploading them?',
    fv9a: "Yes, most online image to PDF converters allow you to reorder images after uploading. You can typically drag and drop images to rearrange them, use arrow buttons to move them up or down, or remove and re-add them in the correct order. This flexibility means you don't need to worry about uploading images in the perfect order initially—you can always adjust the arrangement before converting. The ability to easily reorder images is one of the key advantages of online tools over manual methods.",
    fv10q: 'What happens if my images have different sizes or orientations?',
    fv10a1: 'Most online image to PDF converters handle different image sizes and orientations automatically. Each image typically becomes a separate PDF page, maintaining its original dimensions and orientation. Some tools offer settings to standardize page sizes (like fitting all images to Letter or A4 size) or to auto-rotate images based on their orientation data. For best results, especially for professional documents, you may want to ensure images are oriented correctly before conversion, or use a tool that offers orientation correction features. Mixed orientations in a single PDF are usually fine and can be corrected later using a ',
    fv10aLink: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv10a2: ' if needed.',
    fv11q: 'Can I add text or annotations to the PDF after conversion?',
    fv11a1: 'Yes, after converting images to PDF, you can use a ',
    fv11aLink: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv11a2: ' to add text, annotations, shapes, watermarks, or other elements. Many online PDF editors allow you to add text overlays, highlight areas, draw shapes, or insert additional pages. This makes it easy to create professional documents by starting with image conversion and then adding text, labels, or other content as needed. The combination of image to PDF conversion followed by PDF editing gives you complete control over your final document.',
    fv12q: 'How do I convert HEIC images from my iPhone to PDF?',
    fv12a: 'HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is the default format for iPhone photos, but not all online converters support it directly. You have a few options: First, check if your chosen converter supports HEIC format. If not, you can convert HEIC to JPG first using your iPhone\'s Photos app (share the photo and choose "Save as JPG" or use a HEIC to JPG converter), then convert the JPG files to PDF. Alternatively, some online tools can handle HEIC files directly. Once converted to JPG or if your tool supports HEIC, the conversion to PDF works the same as with any other image format.',
    fv13q: 'Is there a limit to how many images I can convert at once?',
    fv13a: "There's no hard limit on the number of images you can convert, but practical limits exist based on your device's capabilities and browser performance. Most online tools handle 20-50 images comfortably. Very large batches (100+ images) may cause browser slowdowns, memory issues, or timeouts. If you need to convert many images, consider splitting the conversion into multiple batches or using desktop software optimized for large batch processing. The total file size of all images combined also matters—keeping the total under 100-200 MB typically ensures smooth processing.",
