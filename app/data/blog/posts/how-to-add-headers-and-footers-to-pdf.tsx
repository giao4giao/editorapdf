    fv1q: 'How do I add headers and footers to a PDF online for free?',
    fv1aa: 'You can add headers and footers to PDF files online for free by using our ',
    fv1alink: 'PDF header footer tool',
    fv1ab: '. Simply upload your PDF file, customize your header and footer content (text, page numbers, dates, images, etc.), choose the position and styling, and apply them to your document. The tool processes files locally in your browser, ensuring privacy and security. No account creation, payment, or software installation required.',
    fv2q: 'Is it safe to add headers and footers to PDFs online?',
    fv2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF header footer tool that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All processing happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your PDFs are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them.',
    fv3q: 'Can I add page numbers to PDF headers or footers?',
    fv3a: 'Absolutely. Most online PDF header footer tools allow you to add automatic page numbers to headers or footers. You can customize the format (e.g., "Page 1 of 10", "1/10", or just "1"), choose the starting page number, and position the page numbers anywhere in the header or footer area. Page numbers update automatically for each page, making it easy to number large documents consistently.',
    fv4q: 'Can I add different headers and footers to different pages?',
    fv4a: 'Yes, advanced PDF header footer tools allow you to apply different headers and footers to different page ranges. For example, you can have one header for the first page (or no header on the first page), another for odd pages, and another for even pages. This is useful for documents with title pages, chapter pages, or different sections. Some tools also allow you to specify custom page ranges for different header footer configurations.',
    fv5q: 'What content can I add to PDF headers and footers?',
    fv5a: 'You can add various types of content to PDF headers and footers, including: text (company name, document title, author name, custom text), page numbers (automatic or custom formats like "Page 1 of 10"), dates (current date, creation date, or custom dates in various formats), images (logos, watermarks, decorative elements in PNG, JPG, or SVG format), and custom formatting (fonts, colors, sizes, alignment). Most tools support combining multiple elements in a single header or footer.',
    fv6q: 'Will adding headers and footers affect my PDF content?',
    fv6a: 'No, adding headers and footers should not affect your existing PDF content when done properly. Headers and footers are added to the margins of your document, outside the main content area. However, if your PDF already has content very close to the edges, headers and footers might overlap. Most tools allow you to adjust margins to prevent this, and some tools automatically detect content and adjust header footer positioning accordingly.',
    fv7q: 'Can I add images or logos to PDF headers and footers?',
    fv7a: 'Yes, many online PDF header footer tools support adding images and logos to headers and footers. You can upload image files (PNG, JPG, SVG) and position them in your header or footer. This is commonly used for adding company logos, letterheads, or decorative elements to professional documents. Most tools allow you to resize images and position them alongside text content.',
    fv8q: 'Do I need to create an account to add headers and footers to PDFs?',
    fv8a: 'No, many free PDF header footer tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload your PDF, add headers and footers, and download the modified document immediately without signing up. This makes the process faster and more private. Some tools offer optional accounts for saving templates or accessing premium features, but basic header footer functionality is typically available without any registration.',
    fv9q: 'Can I edit or remove headers and footers after adding them?',
    fv9a: 'This depends on the tool you use. Some tools allow you to edit headers and footers by re-processing the original PDF with new settings. However, once headers and footers are added to a PDF, they become part of the document content. To modify them, you would typically need to use the tool again with your original PDF file. Some advanced tools offer templates or saved configurations that make it easier to modify headers and footers later.',
    fv10q: 'What is the maximum file size for adding headers and footers online?',
    fv10aa: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF header footer tools support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files (100+ MB) may cause browser performance issues or timeouts. If you need to add headers and footers to very large PDFs, consider splitting them first using our ',
    fv10alink: 'PDF splitter tool',
    fv10ab: ' or using desktop software designed for heavy-duty processing.',
    fv11q: 'Can I add headers and footers to password-protected PDFs?',
    fv11aa: "This depends on the tool. Most online PDF header footer tools cannot process password-protected PDFs because they can't access the content without the password. You'll need to remove password protection first using a ",
    fv11alink: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv11ab: ' or the software that created the protection, then add headers and footers to the unlocked files. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password.',
    fv12q: 'Can I add headers and footers on mobile devices?',
    fv12a: 'Yes, many online PDF header footer tools work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large files might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller files (under 10 MB) and fewer total pages (under 50). The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens, but core functionality should work.',
