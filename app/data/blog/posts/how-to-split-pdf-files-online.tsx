    faqVisibleH: 'Frequently Asked Questions About Splitting PDFs',

    // Visible FAQ (14) — some answers contain inline links handled in JSX
    fv1q: 'How do I split a PDF file online for free?',
    fv1a1: 'You can split a PDF file online for free by using our ',
    fv1link: 'PDF splitter tool',
    fv1a2: '. Simply upload your PDF file, choose how you want to split it (by page ranges, file size, or bookmarks), and click split. The tool divides your PDF into separate documents that you can download individually or as a ZIP file. No account creation, payment, or software installation required.',
    fv2q: 'Is it safe to split PDFs online?',
    fv2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF splitter that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All splitting happens client-side using JavaScript, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private. Unlike cloud-based tools that upload files to servers, client-side processing means your PDFs are processed entirely on your computer. Always look for tools that explicitly state they process files locally rather than uploading them.',
    fv3q: 'Can I split a PDF into multiple files at once?',
    fv3a: 'Absolutely. Most online PDF splitter tools allow you to split a single PDF into multiple files simultaneously. You can split by page ranges (e.g., pages 1-10, 11-20, 21-30), every N pages, by file size, or by bookmarks. The tool generates all split files at once, which you can download individually or as a ZIP archive for convenience.',
    fv4q: 'What is the maximum file size for splitting PDFs online?',
    fv4a: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF splitters support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files (100+ MB) may cause browser performance issues or timeouts. If you need to split very large PDFs, consider using desktop software designed for heavy-duty processing, or split the file in multiple passes.',
    fv5q: 'Do I need to create an account to split PDF files?',
    fv5a: 'No, many free PDF splitter tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, split, and download your divided PDF files immediately without signing up. This makes the process faster and more private. Some tools offer optional accounts for saving split history or accessing premium features, but basic PDF splitting is typically available without any registration.',
    fv6q: 'Can I split a PDF by page ranges?',
    fv6a: 'Yes, most PDF splitter tools allow you to split by specific page ranges. You can specify which pages to extract into separate files, such as pages 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc. Some tools also support splitting every N pages automatically (e.g., every 5 pages creates a new file every 5 pages). You can also extract individual pages or custom ranges based on your needs.',
    fv7q: 'Can I split a PDF by file size?',
    fv7a: 'Yes, advanced PDF splitter tools offer the ability to split PDFs by file size. You specify a maximum file size (e.g., 5 MB, 10 MB), and the tool automatically divides your PDF into multiple files, each under that size limit. This is particularly useful when you need to email files and have size restrictions, or when you want to optimize file sizes for sharing. The tool intelligently splits at page boundaries to maintain document integrity.',
    fv8q: 'Can I split a PDF by bookmarks?',
    fv8a: 'Yes, if your PDF has bookmarks (table of contents), many PDF splitter tools can use them to automatically split your document. The tool creates a separate file for each bookmark section, making it easy to divide structured documents like reports, books, or manuals. This method is particularly useful for documents that already have a clear organizational structure defined by bookmarks.',
    fv9q: 'Will splitting a PDF reduce file quality?',
    fv9a: "No, properly splitting a PDF should not reduce quality. When you split PDF files using a quality tool, it extracts pages without re-compressing or degrading the content. Each split PDF maintains the same quality as the original pages. However, if you're using a tool that converts PDFs to images and back, quality loss can occur. Look for tools that split PDFs at the native PDF level rather than converting formats.",
    fv10q: 'Can I split password-protected PDFs?',
    fv10a1: "This depends on the tool. Most online PDF splitters cannot process password-protected PDFs because they can't access the content without the password. You'll need to remove password protection first using a ",
    fv10link: 'PDF editing tool',
    fv10a2: ' or the software that created the protection, then split the unlocked files. Some desktop PDF software can handle password-protected files if you provide the password.',
    fv11q: 'What happens to the original PDF after splitting?',
    fv11a: "The original PDF file on your device remains completely unchanged. Splitting creates new files without modifying the source document. This means you can split the same PDF multiple times using different methods or settings without any risk to your original file. Always keep backups of important original files until you're satisfied with the split results.",
    fv12q: 'Can I split PDFs on mobile devices?',
    fv12a: 'Yes, many online PDF splitter tools work on mobile browsers, though the experience may vary. Mobile devices have less processing power and memory than desktop computers, so very large splits might be slower or fail. For best results on mobile, stick to smaller files (under 10 MB) and fewer total pages (under 50). The interface may also be optimized differently for touch screens, but core functionality should work.',
    fv13q: 'How many files can I create from one PDF?',
    fv13a: "There's no hard limit on the number of files you can create, but practical limits exist based on your device's capabilities. Most online tools handle creating 10-20 split files comfortably. Very large splits (50+ files) may cause browser slowdowns or memory issues. If you need to create many files, consider splitting in multiple operations or using desktop software optimized for large batch processing.",

    s7h: 'Conclusion: Making PDF Splitting Simple',
    s7p1: "Splitting PDF files doesn't have to be complicated. With modern online PDF splitter tools, dividing large documents into smaller, more manageable pieces is straightforward, fast, and secure.

    fq1q: 'How do I split a PDF file online for free?',
    fq1a: 'You can split a PDF file online for free by using our PDF splitter tool. Simply upload your PDF file, choose how you want to split it (by page ranges, file size, or bookmarks), and click split. The tool divides your PDF into separate documents that you can download individually or as a ZIP file.',
    fq2q: 'Is it safe to split PDFs online?',
    fq2a: 'Yes, when using a privacy-first PDF splitter that processes files locally in your browser, your documents never leave your device. All splitting happens client-side, ensuring your sensitive documents remain secure and private.',
    fq3q: 'Can I split a PDF into multiple files at once?',
    fq3a: 'Yes, most online PDF splitter tools allow you to split a single PDF into multiple files simultaneously. You can split by page ranges, every N pages, by file size, or by bookmarks. The tool generates all split files at once, which you can download individually or as a ZIP archive.',
    fq4q: 'What is the maximum file size for splitting PDFs online?',
    fq4a: 'File size limits vary by tool, but most online PDF splitters support files up to 25-50 MB. For best performance, keep files under 25 MB and limit the total number of pages to under 200. Very large files may cause browser performance issues.',
    fq5q: 'Do I need to create an account to split PDF files?',
    fq5a: 'No, many free PDF splitter tools work without requiring account creation or registration. You can upload, split, and download your divided PDF files immediately without signing up.',
    fq6q: 'Can I split a PDF by page ranges?',
    fq6a: 'Yes, most PDF splitter tools allow you to split by specific page ranges. You can specify which pages to extract into separate files, such as pages 1-10, 11-20, etc. Some tools also support splitting every N pages automatically.',
    fq7q: 'Can I split a PDF by file size?',
    fq7a: 'Yes, advanced PDF splitter tools offer the ability to split PDFs by file size. You specify a maximum file size (e.g., 5 MB), and the tool automatically divides your PDF into multiple files, each under that size limit.',
    fq8q: 'Will splitting a PDF reduce file quality?',
    fq8a: 'No, properly splitting a PDF should not reduce quality. When you split PDF files using a quality tool, it extracts pages without re-compressing or degrading the content. Each split PDF maintains the same quality as the original pages.',
