### Key Technologies

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS
- **Zustand** - State management
- **PDF.js** - PDF rendering (from Mozilla)
- **pdf-lib** - PDF manipulation

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/React

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Keep components **small and focused**
- Extract reusable logic into **custom hooks**
- Add **JSDoc comments** for complex functions

### Code Style

```typescript
// ✅ Good
export function calculatePageScale(
  pageWidth: number,
  containerWidth: number
): number {
  return Math.min(containerWidth / pageWidth, 3.0);
}

// ❌ Bad
export function calc(w: number, c: number) {
  return Math.min(c / w, 3.0);
}
```

### Tailwind CSS

- Use **utility classes** instead of custom CSS
- Follow **responsive-first** approach
- Use **semantic color names** from the theme
- Group related utilities together

### File Naming

- **Components**: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `PdfViewer.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `pdfRender.ts`)
- **Hooks**: `use*.ts` (e.g., `useKeyboard.ts`)
